# PSOBB MAG Database
This addon provides you with a database full of information on MAGs, such as feeding charts, evolution conditions, and more.

### Installation
1. Install the [addon plugin](https://github.com/HybridEidolon/psobbaddonplugin) for PSOBB.
2. Download this repository by clicking [**here**](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/psobb-mag-database/archive/master.zip).
3. Drag and drop the **MAG Database** addon into the /addons directory in your PSOBB folder.

### How to Use
MAG Database doesn't open automatically since it's a reference resource that you open when you need it. To open the MAG Database :

1. Press the **\`** key to open the main addon menu.
2. Select **MAG Database** from the menu to open the database.

After this you can select a mag from the drop down and narrow down the list by using the filters.
